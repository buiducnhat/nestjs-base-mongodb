  <h1>NestJS Base Code by Gerpann</h1>
</div>


## Description
Base code for developing RESTful Api Web server quickly using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework as the main tech.

***

## Intergrating
* [NestJS](https://nestjs.com) (totaly writing with Typescript)
* [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)
* [Mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) (also support various of [RDMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDMS))
* Logger
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) (OpenAPI) for Api documents
* Health check for server status

***

## Getting started (without Docker)
* Install yarn at global scope (recommended)
```bash
$ npm install -g yarn
```
* Then just run this command for install dependencies
```bash
$ yarn
```
* Before the app can run, remember to create `.env` file for store environment variables (it has the same structure with the `.env.example` file availble).
For quickly:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

***

## Setup Database
This project has already integrated with [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) and Mysql database.<br/>
But you can easily config your database type you want in `ormconfig.ts` and in the `database.module.ts` file.<br/>
*Note that your database can have some different configurations like Mysql)*
* If you see any files in the `src/database/migrations/` folder, you should remove all of them first.
* Add your entities for your project (in each module in `src/modules` folder).
* Make sure that your database is already created and clean. Then generate query for make tables base on your entities you wrote. *Note that you can define file name in the `package.json` file*
```bash
yarn migration:generate
```
* Usually, you have to use the above command only when you want to change your database (TypeORM realize the different in your `entities` and the database you connected). When you want to apply changes to the database. Run command:
```bash
yarn migration:run
```
And the rest scripts is availble in `package.json` file! 

***

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn start

# development with spec (like nodemon)
$ yarn start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn build
$ yarn start:prod
```

***

## Running app with Docker

### Requirements
* Docker
* Docker compose

### Command
```bash
# Remove folder data(contains database data in container) if exist
$ sudo rm -rf data

# Execute app
$ docker-compose up
```

### Note
If you have any changes with the database, you have to generate new migration file.<br/>
Normally, we can easily generate with command ```yarn migration:generate``` but now, with docker, we don't install any dependencies.<br/>
Solution: Run ```docker exec``` to the container that are running the `nest-app`.<br/>
Example:
```bash
$ docker exec -ti nestjs-base_app_1 /bin/sh
```
with `nestjs-base_app_1` is the nestjs app container name (you can configure it in the `docker-compose.yml` file)
Then, you just run command to generate the new migration file (error occurs if there's no change with entities)
```bash
$ yarn migration:generate  
```
Finally, it's ready to execute your app with `docker-compose`.

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
